## PyFileEncryptTool: Final Security Summary of Verison 1

The final version of the script implements the "Easy Button," the "Full Manual Mode," and all security best practices discussed:

### Core Security & Algorithms
* **Encryption Standard:** Uses **AES-256 GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode), which provides both confidentiality and strong, verifiable integrity.
* **Key Derivation:** Uses **Argon2id** with user-tunable parameters (memory, time, lanes) to resist modern brute-force attacks.
* **Password Safety:** Enforces a minimum length of **8 characters** and requires password confirmation during encryption.

### Integrity & Robustness
* **Streaming I/O:** Both encryption and decryption are fully implemented using file streaming, allowing the tool to handle files of **arbitrary size** efficiently without crashing due to high memory use.
* **Atomic Decryption (Safety Guarantee):** Decryption uses a **write-to-temp-then-rename** strategy. The final output file is only written after the cryptographic integrity check (GCM tag verification) passes, preventing system crashes or failures from leaving corrupted, unverified data.
* **Critical Authentication (AAD):** The entire file header (version, KDF parameters, salt, and nonce) is included in the GCM's **Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)**. This prevents any party from tampering with the file's decryption settings without immediately triggering a fatal security error.

### Auditing & Verification
* **Automatic Checksum:** The tool automatically calculates and records the original file's **SHA-256 checksum** in the JSON report during encryption.
* **Verification Mode:** The `--verify-report-path` flag enables automatic integrity verification during decryption, confirming the decrypted content matches the historical record.
* **Insecure Override (`--force-insecure-decrypt`):** Included for security demonstration, this highly-warned flag allows bypassing the GCM integrity check to save corrupted data, with the resulting file clearly renamed using the `.unverified_corrupt` suffix.
